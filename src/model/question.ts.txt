Module created by David Hern√°ndez on QP 2018/19 (Feb19 - Jun19) Contact: erdeivit@gmail.com

This module is part of the questionnaires block.

This modulle allows to get the information about the server.
Thanks to the construct method, it can collect the data from the server (classpip-services) and assign it to local variables.

Thanks to the getters and the setters that are created we can access to the data easily just creating a variable of the class.

Ej:
public question: Question;
this.question.id;
